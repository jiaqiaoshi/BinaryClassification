# BinaryClassification
Survival Prediction of Titanic Disaster
• Implemented by Python with Scikit-learn, Pandas & Numpy to predict whether a passenger would have been survived or not by applying binary machine learning algorithms as classifiers.
• The process involved: Data Preprocess & Visualization, applied Crossing Validation on 5 classic classification algorithms including KNeighbors, Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, tuning hyperparameters combinations by GridSearchCV, import Confusion Matrix & Classification Report for evaluation.
